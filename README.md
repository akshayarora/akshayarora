# Akshay Arora

I'm a software engineer and manager with 20+ years of experience in several platforms/frameworks, langauges and industries. I'm an engineering leader with a solid history of solving technical problems and leading teams that solve the technical and product problems. I love thinking about product and engineering solutions together - I like to straddle that line and think about it all as a whole.
