# Akshay Arora

I'm an engineering leader and manager with 20+ years of experience with several platforms/frameworks, langauges and industries. I have a solid history of solving technical problems and leading teams that solve the technical and product problems. I love thinking about product and engineering solutions together - I like to straddle that line and think about it all as a whole.
